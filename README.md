# Power Factor Monitoring System using ESP32

This Arduino-based project demonstrates a real-time power factor monitoring system utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller. It analyzes analog input signals from voltage and current sensors to calculate and display RMS voltage, RMS current, and the power factor (PF) of an AC load. The system is designed for educational purposes, embedded systems learning, and rapid prototyping.

This project leverages several key Arduino and ESP-IDF libraries to manage multitasking, networking, sensor data processing, and display functions:

* **`freertos/FreeRTOS.h`, `/task.h`, `/semphr.h`:** Enables multi-core task management on the ESP32. These are crucial for separating data acquisition (ISR) from data processing, display, and data upload tasks, ensuring efficient and real-time operation.
* **`WiFi.h`, `WiFiClient.h`:** Used to establish Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing the ESP32 to upload power factor and RMS data to a remote server or cloud service.
* **`HTTPClient.h`:** Facilitates making HTTP POST/GET requests for uploading collected data to platforms like Blynk, ThingSpeak, or a custom server.
* **`Filters.h`:** Employed for real-time RMS calculation of analog voltage and current signals. This library simplifies signal filtering and ensures accurate energy measurement.
* **`cmath`:** Provides essential mathematical functions such as `sqrt()` and trigonometric calculations, which are fundamental for power factor computations.
* **`esp_timer.h`:** Utilizes the ESP32‚Äôs high-resolution timer functions for precise sampling and timing within the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
* **`Wire.h`:** Enables I2C communication between the ESP32 and the LCD display module.
* **`LiquidCrystal_I2C.h`:** Controls the I2C LCD display, simplifying text and data output.

## üèóÔ∏è System Overview

The system is designed for efficient and accurate real-time power factor monitoring:
